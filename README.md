# Embedded Systems Examples
Welcome to the **Embedded Systems Examples** repository! This repository contains a collection of code examples, tutorials, and snippets for working with embedded systems, including STM32 and Arduino projects. Each example focuses on different peripherals or functionalities, such as ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converters), GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output), UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter), and more.

# About

This repository aims to provide useful examples and hands-on exercises for developers working with embedded systems. The code is written using register-level programming for STM32 microcontrollers and standard Arduino libraries.

Each folder contains a README specific to the example, detailing the project, the hardware setup, and instructions on how to compile and run the code.
